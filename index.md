## 💼 Project Experience

### 📖 Project 1: **Incident Response Playbook**
**Objective:** Create a detailed playbook to guide organizations through incident handling related to `malware`, `ransomware`, `web defacement`, and `DDoS`.

**Methodology:**  
* Documented step-by-step procedures for identification & analysis, containment, remediation and post-incident.  
* Coordinated between SMEs and SOC teams to standardize response protocols.

**Outcome:** Reduced incident resolution time and improved organizational readiness for incidents.

### 🛡️ Project 2: **Security Infrastructure Hardening and Best Practices**
**Objective:** Strengthen security infrastructure by applying best practices and addressing trending vulnerabilities.

**Methodology:**
* Conducted a security configuration review of critical systems (e.g., WAF, IDS/IPS, endpoint security) against industry benchmarks (e.g., NIST/CIS Controls).
* Updated security solutions and configurations in response to evolving threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4j, proxy shell).
* Implemented hardening measures, such as disabling unused ports, enforcing MFA, and auditing privileged access.
* Delivered training and best practices documentation for team members to ensure consistent security implementation.
  
**Outcome:** Reduced attack surface across the infrastructure and achieved zero critical misconfigurations in internal audits.
